How to play

Hi guys, today I will introduce to you a game I designed myself, using C++ and SDL2. 
 - The game is called Find Treasure. 
 - Our character has the main task of going through the dangerous forest to reach the treasure. He can only go straight, there is no way back, he finds treasure or dies in this deadly forest. 
 - You use the right mouse button to jump up, the left mouse button to shoot bullets. In the forest, there are two things to avoid: zombie's hands and zombies. The zombie can attack you. But you can use the gun to destroy them, or you can jump over. The zombie's hand is not, you must jump over it. If you collide with their, you will die. 
 - To be the winner, not only do you find the treasure, but it also depends on the amount of gold you eat, the number of zombies you shoot, and the time you reach the treasure. This is really an exciting journey, it is waiting for you.
 - How to calculate points: you will take the time minus the gold multiplied by 5 and the number of zombies multiplied by 10. The smaller this number, the more you are the winner.

Wish you happy playing! <3
